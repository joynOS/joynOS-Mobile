# Joyn OS — Terms of Service (Draft)

Last updated: August 8, 2025

## 1) Who we are and how to contact us
Joyn OS, Inc. ("Joyn OS," "we," "us," or "our") offers a mobile platform that converts a user’s “I’m free now” intent into safe, real‑world micro‑hangouts using AI matching, short commitment windows, and optional reservations ("Services").

## 2) Acceptance of these Terms
By creating an account, accessing, or using the Services, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the Services. We may update these Terms from time to time and will notify you in‑app or by email; your continued use means you accept the changes.

## 3) Eligibility & account rules
- **Age**: You must be 18 or older. No accounts for minors.
- **Launch geography**: The early release is focused on New York City; features may be geogated during the MVP.
- **Account & verification**: You agree to provide accurate information. We may require selfie or government‑ID verification to access or retain access to certain features; verification does not guarantee someone’s identity or safety.
- **One account per person**: You will not share your account or create accounts on behalf of others without permission.

## 4) The Services (what we provide)
Joyn OS helps you: (a) capture live availability and activity/budget preferences; (b) receive AI‑assisted match cards with a 15‑minute acceptance window; (c) chat in a lobby with ice‑breakers; (d) pick between two AI‑generated plan options; and (e) commit and check‑in when you arrive. We offer an “Explain my match” panel that summarizes high‑level factors (e.g., shared interests, timing overlap, coarse location buckets, and reliability tier badges) without exposing sensitive inputs or exact locations. We also provide optional reservation routing via third‑party directories/APIs (e.g., OpenTable, Resy, SevenRooms, Ticketmaster) and mapping links. Availability is not guaranteed.

Important: Joyn OS is not a dating service, background‑check service, event organizer, or travel/venue provider. We surface options and help coordinate; you are responsible for your choices and your offline conduct.

## 5) Safety features (and limits)
We provide block/report, optional verification, a blurred‑radius location mode, check‑in flows (manual plus 150‑meter geofence fallback), and internal reputation signals aimed at discouraging no‑shows and abuse. These features reduce risk but cannot eliminate it. Always exercise caution when meeting new people.

## 6) Reliability score, timers, and feature access
To support trust, Joyn OS may apply timers and an internal reliability signal (e.g., commitment/cancellation patterns). Examples include: a T‑2h commit decision and reputation impact for late skips/no‑shows; persistent low reliability may throttle feed density or limit features. You may see non‑numeric badges (e.g., “Reliable”); we do not show your numeric score.

## 7) Purchases, subscriptions, and payments
- **Commit Boost & other paid features**: The app may offer in‑app purchases (e.g., Commit Boost with time‑of‑day tiers). Prices and a clear disclosure are shown before you buy. All charges are handled by our payment processor (currently Stripe); you authorize Joyn OS to charge your chosen payment method for purchases and applicable taxes/fees.
- **Tickets, tabs, and venue payments**: Some plans may include prepayment, deposits, or ticketing via third parties. Their terms apply. Joyn OS may act as a limited collection agent and/or receive a commission from participating partners; we will show you the total you pay before purchase.
- **Refunds**: Except where required by law, purchases are non‑refundable once a plan locks or a digital item is delivered. If a venue cancels, we will seek a refund or credit from the partner on your behalf where possible.

## 8) User content and license
You may create or upload content (e.g., messages, profile photos, lobby names, plan titles). You grant Joyn OS a worldwide, royalty‑free, sublicensable license to host, store, reproduce, modify, publish, and display your content solely to operate and improve the Services. You represent you have the necessary rights to the content you post. We may remove content that violates these Terms or our guidelines.

## 9) Acceptable use
You agree not to:
- harass, stalk, dox, or discriminate against others;
- share others’ personal data without consent;
- spam, scam, or conduct illegal activity;
- attempt to reverse engineer or scrape our Services; or
- circumvent safety features or misrepresent your identity.

We may suspend or terminate accounts that breach these rules.

## 10) AI features and accuracy
We use AI and other automated systems to generate plan options and match suggestions. Outputs may be incomplete or wrong, venue data can be stale, and availability can change. These are recommendations, not professional advice. You are responsible for your decisions.

## 11) Third‑party services
Our Services link to or rely on third‑party platforms (e.g., maps, reservation and ticketing providers, payments). Their terms and privacy practices govern your use of those features. We are not responsible for their acts or omissions.

## 12) Changes, availability, and beta features
We may add, change, or remove features and may suspend the Services for maintenance, security, or legal reasons. Early‑access or beta features may be unstable and can be withdrawn at any time.

## 13) Termination
You may stop using the Services at any time. We may suspend or terminate your account for violations of these Terms, risk to others, non‑payment, or legal/regulatory reasons. On termination, certain sections (e.g., intellectual property, disclaimers, limitations of liability, dispute resolution) survive.

## 14) Disclaimers; limitation of liability
The Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Joyn OS will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenues, data, or goodwill. Our aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Services is limited to the greater of (a) $100 or (b) the amounts you paid to Joyn OS in the 12 months before the claim.

## 15) Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold Joyn OS, its officers, employees, and partners harmless from claims, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your misuse of the Services, your content, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

## 16) Dispute resolution; governing law
- **Governing law & venue**: These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflicts of laws), and disputes will be resolved in New York County, New York, unless preempted by arbitration below.
- **Arbitration & class‑action waiver (U.S.)**: Except for small‑claims matters or where prohibited by law, disputes will be resolved by binding individual arbitration under the rules of JAMS. No class actions or class arbitrations. You may opt out within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing [insert email] with subject “Arbitration opt‑out.”
- Nothing in this section limits rights that cannot be waived by law.

## 17) Additional notices about safety and regulation
Joyn OS is designed to reduce endless scrolling and emphasize “moments over feeds,” aligning with evolving expectations around algorithmic transparency and location privacy. Our product includes optional blurred location and an “Explain my match” panel to increase clarity for users.

## 18) Entire agreement; severability; assignment; waiver
These Terms (plus any feature‑specific terms and our Privacy Policy) are the entire agreement between you and Joyn OS. If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. We may assign these Terms; you may not without our consent. Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.
